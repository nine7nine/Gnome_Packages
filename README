README

- Arch packages / patches that i use for gnome 41

experimental. i break a few things in my quest to have a gnome-based desktop 
that i like. Overview is killed. i use the gnome-rounded patch with my own 
animation / blur fixes.

no support provided. i only test in Xorg and i use SSDs, not gnome CSDs.
